* Thunderbird native message extension server


orignal readme is bellow
* Native Messaging Example

This example demonstrates communication between a WebExtension and a native application using native messaging.

** Overview

- The WebExtension (in the "add-on" directory) connects to the native application and sends/receives messages.
- Clicking the WebExtension's browser action sends a "ping" message.
- The native application (in the "app" directory), written in Python, responds with a "pong" message.

** Setup

*** Linux/macOS

0. (macOS) Place the extension outside Desktop, Documents, or Downloads due to macOS access restrictions.

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed and in your PATH.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   which python3
   #+END_SRC
   - If not found, install Python 3. See:
     - [[https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html][Using Python on Unix platforms (Linux)]]
     - [[https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html][Using Python on a Mac (macOS)]]
   - Restart Firefox after modifying PATH.

2. Grant execute permission to `app/ping_pong.py`.
   - See [[https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-file-permissions-explained][RedHat's article on file permissions]].

3. Update the `"path"` field in `app/ping_pong.json` with the full path to `app/ping_pong.py`.
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   "path": "/path/to/your/webextensions-examples/native-messaging/app/ping_pong.py"
   #+END_SRC

4. Copy `app/ping_pong.json` to the correct location. See:
   - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#linux][Linux manifest location]]
   - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#macos][macOS manifest location]]
   - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Manifest_location][App manifest location]]

** Testing

1. Install the add-on:
   - Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` (or "This Firefox" in `about:debugging`).
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the add-on's `manifest.json`.

2. Open the extension's console using the "Inspect" button.

3. Click the new browser action icon in the toolbar.

4. Check the console for output similar to:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Sending: ping
   Received: pong
   #+END_EXAMPLE

5. If you encounter issues, consult the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#Troubleshooting][Troubleshooting guide]].
